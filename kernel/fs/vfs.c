/*
 * kernel/fs/vfs.c
 * Virtual Filesystem Switch — provider registry, mount table, dispatch.
 *
 * Purpose (VFS-01 resolved):
 *   The kernel-core side of the filesystem provider contract defined in
 *   <kernel/vfs.h>.  Holds the registered fs drivers and the mount table,
 *   probes partitions at vfs_init(), and dispatches the vfs_* API through
 *   the mounted provider's fs_ops.  Also provides vfs_resolve_path(), the
 *   path canonicalisation helper used by the syscall layer.
 *
 * Role in the stack (ASTRA, docs/ASTRA.md):
 *   syscall_dispatch.c / elf.c  →  vfs_* (this file)  →  fs_ops provider
 *   (ext4 today).  No caller outside kernel/fs/ touches ext4_* anymore.
 *
 * Resolution model:
 *   Single root mount ("/"): the first registered provider that successfully
 *   mounts a partition (probed in partition-table order) becomes the root.
 *   Multiple mounts/mountpoints are a later step (the table is already
 *   sized for them).
 *
 * Key invariants:
 *   - vfs_resolve_path output is always NUL-terminated.
 *   - Normalisation is done entirely in-place on a stack copy; the original
 *     'in' string is never modified.
 *   - parts[] stores interior pointers into temp[]; they remain valid for the
 *     lifetime of the normalisation loop because temp[] is on the same frame.
 *
 * Known issues:
 *   VFS-02  RESOLVED (Phase B2): vfs_resolve_path() guards current_process;
 *           a relative path resolved from kernel context (no process) is now
 *           treated as relative to "/".
 *   VFS-03  (W2 BAD-IMPL) parts[32] limits the resolved path to 32 components;
 *           deeper paths are silently truncated with no error returned.
 *   VFS-04  (W1 REFINE) temp[256] and normalized[256] are both stack-allocated.
 *           A CWD of 127 bytes + in of 128 bytes = 255 chars before the NUL;
 *           strncat guards the overflow but silently truncates the result.

 * vfs_resolve_path - canonicalise a raw user path into an absolute path string.
 *
 * @in:   input path (absolute or relative; not modified).
 * @out:  output buffer; receives the NUL-terminated absolute path.
 * @size: capacity of out[], including the NUL terminator.
 *
 * Preconditions:
 *   - out != NULL, size >= 1.
 *   - If in is relative and a current process exists, its cwd must be a
 *     valid NUL-terminated string.  Without a current process (kernel
 *     context) relative paths resolve from "/" (FIX VFS-02).
 *
 * Algorithm:
 *   1. Build temp[] = (absolute ? in : cwd + "/" + in), truncated to 255 chars.
 *   2. Walk temp[] splitting on '/', accumulating component pointers in
 *      parts[0..31].  ".." decrements part_count; "." is skipped.
 *      NOTE(VFS-03): parts[] has only 32 slots; the 33rd and later components
 *      are silently dropped — no error is returned to the caller.
 *   3. Reassemble parts[] into normalized[] with leading '/'.
 *   4. strncpy into out[]; force-NUL-terminate at out[size-1].
 *      NOTE(VFS-04): Both temp[] and normalized[] are 256-byte stack buffers.
 *      A CWD near 128 bytes joined with 'in' near 128 bytes will be silently
 *      truncated by strncat before the normalisation loop starts.
 *
 * Side effects: none (no disk I/O, no locks).
 *
 * Returns: void; result is written to out[].
 *
 * Path Resolution:
 * - If path starts with '/', it's absolute.
 * - Otherwise, it's relative to current_process->cwd.
 * - Normalizes . and ..
