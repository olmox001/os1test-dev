/*
 * kernel/graphics/graphics.c
 * Graphics Subsystem (Bridging HAL and GL)
 *
 * Role:
 *   Thin HAL bridge between the GPU device driver and the GL rasteriser.
 *   Initialises a single global graphics_context (g_ctx) from the primary
 *   GPU device obtained via gpu_get_primary(), then provides convenience
 *   wrappers that acquire a gl_surface each call and forward to gl_*.
 *
 * Invariants:
 *   - g_ctx is populated by graphics_init() and never mutated afterwards.
 *   - All draw wrappers silently no-op if gpu_get_primary() returns NULL.
 *   - graphics_swap_buffers() is a memory-barrier-only stub; the subsystem
 *     operates in single-buffered mode (backbuffer lives in compositor.c).
 *
 * Known issues:
 *   GFX-GFX-01 (W0 DOC) graphics_get_screen_surface() returns a pointer to a
 *               function-static local.  The returned pointer is stable under a
 *               uniprocessor kernel but is NOT safe if two CPUs call this
 *               concurrently and both store the pointer across a preemption
 *               window — the struct is silently overwritten by the second
 *               caller.  Worth a comment at the call site; no functional bug
 *               under the current single-core model.
