/*
 * kernel/sched/process.c
 * Process Management, Scheduler, and IPC
 *
 * This file owns the core process model and the OS1/NEXS scheduler:
 *   - A fixed pool of MAX_PROCESSES (64) process descriptors allocated from
 *     the PMM one page each.
 *   - Per-CPU O(1) priority-bitmap runqueues (MAX_PRIO levels) with
 *     work-stealing between CPUs using trylock to avoid AB-BA deadlocks.
 *   - Deferred-free: a process terminated while running on another CPU is
 *     marked PROC_DEAD and freed on the *next* schedule() call on that CPU,
 *     after the kernel stack is no longer in use.
 *   - A kmalloc-backed linked-list IPC per process (msg_queue), with
 *     sleeping-receiver wakeup on send.
 *   - sys_sbrk: demand-mapped user heap extending upward from the top of the
 *     ELF segments, with no upper-bound check against the user stack.
 *
 * Locking hierarchy (must be acquired in this order):
 *   sched_lock (global) -> target->msg_lock -> target_cpu->sched_lock
 *
 * Key invariants:
 *   - current_process is a per-CPU variable (accessed via get_cpu_info());
 *     safe to read/write without a lock during a syscall or IRQ on that CPU.
 *   - The idle task for each CPU is created by smp_create_idle_task(); its
 *     page_table is NULL and it is never enqueued or stolen by work-stealing.
 *   - process_pool[] slot is set to NULL only after the process struct and
 *     kernel stack are freed (or deferred via cpu_ptr->deferred_free_proc).
 *   - PIDs are assigned from next_pid (monotonically increasing, never reused).
 *
 * Known issues:
 *   SCHED-01  (W3 WRONG-DESIGN) schedule() calls compositor_get_focus_pid()
 *             and gives the focused window's process priority access to the
 *             runqueue — the kernel scheduler depends on the graphics
 *             compositor, inverting the correct dependency.
 *   SCHED-02  (W2 BAD-IMPL) schedule() is large and intricate; many pc==0
 *             panic guards betray past context-corruption bugs.
 *   SCHED-03  (W2 WRONG-DESIGN, MITIGATED) process_wait() is non-blocking
 *             (returns -1 while target is alive).  Zombies are now auto-reaped
 *             by schedule() (prev==ZOMBIE -> reap stack), so unwaited children
 *             no longer leak pool slots; exit-status collection for a future
 *             blocking wait() still needs parent/child links (SCHED-06).
 *   SCHED-04  (W2 BUG/DOC) Comment in process_create says "Kernel Stack (16KB)"
 *             but STACK_SIZE is 128KB.
 *   SCHED-05  (W3 BUG/SECURITY) kernel_ipc_send() nests sched_lock -> msg_lock
 *             -> cpu->sched_lock — an AB-BA deadlock risk acknowledged in code
 *             comments.  Additionally, msg_queue is unbounded: a sender can OOM
 *             a receiver with no flow control.
 *   SCHED-06  (W2 WRONG-DESIGN) No parent/child relationship; process_wait()
 *             accepts any PID; no process groups or sessions.
 *   SCHED-07  (W2 BUG) sys_sbrk() has no upper-bound check; heap can collide
 *             with the fixed user stack at 0xC0000000.
 *   SCHED-08  (W1 PERF) process_create() zeros the PMM page with memset()
 *             even though pmm_alloc_page() already zeroes it.
 *   IPC-01    RESOLVED — lost-wakeup race: the sender wakes a target only if
 *             it reads PROC_SLEEPING, so a receiver between its failed queue
 *             check and setting SLEEPING could sleep forever on a non-empty
 *             queue.  sys_ipc_recv() now re-checks the queue under msg_lock
 *             (the lock the sender appends under) and sleeps only if still
 *             empty.

 *  1. Save current context (regs) and re-enqueue prev if PROC_RUNNING;
 *     idle tasks are never re-enqueued (they are not on any runqueue).
 *  2. Focus boost (SCHED-01): call compositor_get_focus_pid() and search
 *     all priority levels for the focused PID first.
 *  3. O(1) pick: __builtin_ctz(prio_bitmap) finds the lowest-numbered
 *     non-empty priority queue in one instruction; pop the head task.
 *  4. Work stealing: if local runqueue is empty, iterate over other CPUs
 *     with spin_trylock (to avoid deadlock) and steal the highest-priority
 *     task.  Idle-priority tasks are never stolen (they own their CPU's
 *     kernel stack).
 *  5. Context switch: install next->page_table (if changed), call
 *     arch_cpu_switch_context(next), and return next->context.
 *
 * Locking: acquires cpu_ptr->sched_lock (irqsave) for the duration of steps
 *          1-5; temporarily acquires other_cpu->sched_lock (trylock) during
 *          work stealing; acquires sched_lock (irqsave) during deferred free.
 *          Releases all locks before returning.
 * IRQ contract (SCHED-IRQ-01): schedule() masks IRQs itself at entry and is

 *          returns with IRQs masked and the dispatcher's IRET/ERET loads the
 *          next context's saved flags.
 *
 * NOTE(SCHED-01): compositor_get_focus_pid() is called on every schedule()
 *          invocation — the kernel scheduler has a compile-time dependency on
 *          the graphics compositor. [W3 WRONG-DESIGN]
