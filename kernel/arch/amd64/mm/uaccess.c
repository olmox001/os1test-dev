 * kernel/arch/amd64/mm/uaccess.c
 * Kernel-to-User and User-to-Kernel Memory Copy Primitives (AMD64)
 *
 * Purpose:
 *   Provide arch_copy_from_user, arch_copy_to_user, and
 *   arch_copy_string_from_user.  These are called by syscall handlers that
 *   need to read or write user-space buffers.  On AMD64, the user PML4 is
 *   already loaded in CR3 (unified address space), so no TTBR switch is needed
 *   (unlike aarch64 which must swap TTBR0_EL1).  Validation is done via
 *   vmm_is_user_addr (range check) and vmm_check_range (page-table walk).
 *
 * Invariants:
 *   - current_process != NULL and current_process->page_table != NULL before
 *     any copy function is called (each function checks and returns -1).
 *   - Source/destination addresses must satisfy vmm_is_user_addr for every
 *     byte in the range.
 *
 * Known issues:
 *   UACC-AMD64-01 (W2 DOC/MISSING) The file header and the module-level
 *     comment below claim "stac/clac" SMAP protection.  No stac/clac
 *     instructions are emitted.  CR4.SMAP is NOT enabled in cpu.c:36-39 (only
 *     OSFXSR/OSXMMEXCPT are set).  Currently harmless because SMAP is off, but
 *     the comment creates a false security guarantee.  If SMAP is enabled in
 *     the future without adding stac/clac, every uaccess call traps.
 *   UACC-AMD64-02 (W3 SECURITY/TOCTOU) arch_copy_from_user: vmm_check_range
 *     runs at :23, memcpy runs at :26 — no lock between them.  On SMP, a
 *     concurrent munmap between the check and the copy allows the copy to read
 *     a freed or remapped page.  Fix: hold mm_lock + disable IRQs around both.
 *   UACC-AMD64-03 (W3 SECURITY/TOCTOU) arch_copy_to_user: same TOCTOU window
 *     at :37-41.
 *   UACC-AMD64-04 (W3 SECURITY) arch_copy_string_from_user: the first byte
 *     of 'src' is not validated via vmm_check_range before reading if it is
 *     not at a page boundary (the per-page check fires only at 0-mod-0x1000).
 *     A user can place src at the last byte of a valid page so the initial
 *     vmm_is_user_addr passes, then the string extends unmapped into the next
 *     page.  Also shares the TOCTOU window of UACC-AMD64-02.
 *   UACC-AMD64-05 (W2 BUG) Overflow check at :19 'src_addr + n < src_addr'
 *     does not catch src_addr + n == 0 (the exact canonical boundary); the
 *     vmm_is_user_addr(0) check catches the 0 case, but a range whose end
 *     equals exactly the top of user VA (0xFFFF000000000000) passes the
 *     overflow test and is only caught by the second vmm_is_user_addr call.
 *     Edge case; not immediately exploitable.

/*
 * AMD64 uses a unified address space: the user PML4 is already in CR3 when
 * a syscall handler runs.  No TTBR switch (unlike aarch64) is needed.
 * NOTE(UACC-AMD64-01): The original comment claims "we only need to bypass
 * SMAP (stac)" — but no stac/clac instructions are emitted here and CR4.SMAP
 * is not enabled in cpu.c.  The comment overstates the security protection.

/*
 * arch_copy_from_user - copy 'n' bytes from user-space 'src' to kernel 'dest'.
 *
 * Validation steps (in order):
 *   1. Wrap-around check: src+n < src would indicate integer overflow.
 *   2. Range check: both src and src+n must be in the canonical user VA range
 *      (vmm_is_user_addr, typically [0x1000, 0xFFFF000000000000)).
 *      NOTE(UACC-AMD64-05): src+n == canonical boundary is an edge case.
 *   3. Null process/page_table guard.
 *   4. vmm_check_range: walks the page table to confirm all pages are present.
 *   5. memcpy: the actual copy.
 *
 * NOTE(UACC-AMD64-02): No lock is held between vmm_check_range (:23) and
 * memcpy (:26).  On SMP a concurrent munmap between these two steps allows
 * the memcpy to access a freed page.  The aarch64 equivalent holds mm_lock
 * and disables IRQs around both.
 *
 * Returns 0 on success, -1 on any validation failure.

 * is caught at the first i that is 0-mod-0x1000, which is the START of page
 * N+1, not the boundary.  For src at offset 1 of a page: i=4095 crosses the
 * boundary but is not 0-mod-0x1000 (4096 mod 4096 == 0 is the check for i=4095
 * pointing to &src[4095] = src+4095 ... actually at i=4095 addr=src+4095 mod
 * 0xFFF is != 0 if src is not page-aligned — so the check may not fire at the
 * crossing point).  Also has the same TOCTOU window as UACC-AMD64-02.
