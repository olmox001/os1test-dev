/*
 * kernel/arch/aarch64/cpu/cpu.c
 * AArch64 CPU initialisation, synchronous exception dispatch, and SMP support.
 *
 * Role:
 *   This file owns three distinct concerns for the AArch64 port:
 *   1. Per-CPU hardware initialisation (CPACR, NEON, VBAR installation).
 *   2. The C-level synchronous exception handler (sync_handler), which is the
 *      top of the dispatch chain entered from exception.S's vector_stub macro.
 *      It decodes ESR_EL1.EC and routes to the syscall handler, the memory-probe
 *      recovery path, or a per-EL fault printer / panic / process terminator.
 *   3. SMP helper routines: per-CPU kernel stack management, secondary-CPU PGD
 *      propagation, and the early MMU-enable sequence (arch_vmm_init_hw).
 *
 * Invariants:
 *   - sync_handler is called with IRQs already masked (DAIF.I/F set by hardware
 *     on exception entry); it may only re-enable IRQs under specific recovery
 *     paths (see is_kernel_user_access_fault branch).
 *   - arch_vmm_init_hw must be called exactly once on the primary CPU before any
 *     secondary CPU is woken; secondaries read secondary_ttbr0 after this point.
 *   - CPACR_EL1.FPEN is set to 0b11 on every CPU so that the full NEON register
 *     set can be saved/restored by exception.S (q0–q31, FPSR, FPCR).
 *
 * Known issues:
 *   ARCH-04 (W2 BAD-IMPL·BUG)  FDT memory parse often fails; the manual probe
 *            fallback in arch_platform_get_mem_regions (platform.c:62–96) then
 *            sets arch_mem_regions[0] twice — once at lines 83–86 and again at
 *            91–94 — the second write silently overrides the first. See
 *            platform.c comments for detail.
 *   ARCH-05 (W2 REFINE) The probe relies on sync_handler's probe_in_progress
 *            shortcut; a fault during probing of device memory windows may
 *            trigger undesirable side-effects before the handler fires.
 *   AMMU-08 (W2 BUG) arch_vmm_init_hw issues TLB flush only on the current CPU;
 *            no SMP TLB shootdown is performed when secondary CPUs arrive.
 *   CPU-AARCH64-01 (W2 REFINE) sync_handler: a wild kernel pointer that
 *            happens to fall in the user VA range is misclassified as a
 *            kernel-uaccess fault, leading to silent process termination instead
 *            of a kernel panic. [static]
 *   SYS-AARCH64-02 (W2 BAD-IMPL) The is_kernel_user_access_fault recovery
 *            path unconditionally releases current_process->mm_lock and calls
 *            local_irq_enable(), assuming exact lock discipline that is not
 *            documented or enforced. A future refactor of uaccess critical
 *            sections could silently violate this coupling.

 * sync_handler - C-level synchronous exception handler called from exception.S.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   frame  Pointer to the 816-byte exception frame pushed on the kernel stack by
 *          the vector_stub macro in exception.S.  The handler may modify frame->elr
 *          to change the return address (e.g., probe recovery), or swap in a
 *          different frame pointer entirely (e.g., schedule() returning a new task).
 *
 * Returns: pointer to the exception frame that should be restored on eret.
 *          Normally the same frame; after schedule() it is the new task's frame.
 *
 * EL context: entered at EL1 with IRQs masked (DAIF.I set by hardware).
 *
 * EC decoding (ESR_EL1[31:26]):
 *   0x00  Unknown / uncategorized — print and fall through to fault handler.
 *   0x15  SVC instruction from AArch64 EL0 — dispatch to syscall_handler().
 *   0x20  Instruction Abort from lower EL (EL0 code page fault).
 *   0x21  Instruction Abort from same EL (EL1 code fault — kernel bug).
 *   0x24  Data Abort from lower EL (EL0 load/store fault).
 *   0x25  Data Abort from same EL (EL1 load/store fault — kernel bug or probe).
 *   0x26  SP alignment fault.
 *   other  Unhandled — print and panic (kernel) or terminate (user).
 *
 * Probe recovery path (probe_in_progress == true):
 *   If a Data or Instruction Abort occurs while probe_in_progress is set,
 *   probe_failed is marked and ELR_EL1 is advanced by 4 to skip the faulting
 *   single instruction.  This is the only case where the handler returns early
 *   without the full fault-classification logic.
 *   NOTE(ARCH-05): See probe_in_progress declaration for caveats on real hardware.
 *
 * Fault classification (for all non-SVC ECs):
 *   is_user_fault       — SPSR.M[3:0] == 0b0000 (EL0t, i.e. exception came from EL0).
 *   is_kernel_user_access_fault — kernel was executing but FAR_EL1 points into user
 *                         VA range; implies an arch_copy_from/to_user access faulted.
 *
 *   NOTE(CPU-AARCH64-01): A wild kernel pointer coincidentally in user VA range is
 *   misclassified as is_kernel_user_access_fault and leads to process termination
 *   instead of a kernel panic.  [static]
 *
 * User / uaccess fault handling:
 *   The current process is terminated and schedule() is called to pick a new task.
 *   NOTE(SYS-AARCH64-02): If is_kernel_user_access_fault is true, this code assumes
 *   the faulting code held mm_lock and had IRQs disabled, and unconditionally calls
 *   spin_unlock + local_irq_enable before process_terminate.  This is fragile; any
 *   future change to the uaccess critical section discipline must update this path.
 *
 * Kernel fault handling: dumps all registers and calls panic().

 *
 * Sequence (ARM64 Reference Manual, D5-2 required order):
 *   1. MAIR_EL1  — memory attribute palette used by page-table attribute indices.
 *      Attr0 (index 0) = 0xFF = Normal Write-Back/Write-Allocate (cacheable).
 *      Attr1 (index 1) = 0x04 = Device nGnRE (non-gathering, non-reordering,

 *
 *   2. TCR_EL1   — translation control (VA size, granule, cacheability).
 *      T0SZ  [5:0]  = 16 → TTBR0 covers 2^(64-16) = 48-bit VA.
 *      IRGN0 [9:8]  = 0b01 → inner write-back/write-allocate (cacheable walks).
 *      ORGN0 [11:10]= 0b01 → outer write-back/write-allocate.
 *      SH0   [13:12]= 0b11 → inner-shareable page table walks.
 *      TG0   [15:14]= 0b00 → 4KB granule for TTBR0.
 *      EPD1  [23]   = 1    → disable TTBR1 translation (no higher-half split yet).
 *      IPS   [34:32]= 0    → 32-bit PA (sufficient for QEMU virt at 0x40000000;
 *                            limits PA to 4GB, undersized for real hardware).
 *
 *   3. TTBR0_EL1 — install the kernel PGD; TLB flushed before and after.
 *
 *   4. SCTLR_EL1 — enable MMU (M=1), D-cache (C=1), I-cache (I=1).
 *      RES1 bits [29,28,23,22,20,11] are set as required by the architecture.
 *      Alignment check (A, bit 1) and stack alignment check (SA, bit 3) are
 *      disabled for compatibility with existing kernel code that does not
 *      guarantee 16-byte aligned stack access on every path.
