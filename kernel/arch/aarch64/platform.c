/*
 * kernel/arch/aarch64/platform.c
 * Platform hardware discovery and SMP bring-up for AArch64 (QEMU virt machine).
 *
 * Role:
 *   This file implements the arch_platform_* interface declared in
 *   kernel/include/kernel/platform.h for the AArch64 target.  It is responsible
 *   for three tasks:
 *   1. Early init (arch_platform_early_init): register the GIC interrupt
 *      controller and initialise the FDT/DTB parser.
 *   2. Memory discovery (arch_platform_get_mem_regions): obtain a list of usable
 *      RAM regions for the PMM.  Primary path: FDT "memory" node parse.  Fallback:
 *      manual physical-page probe using the probe_in_progress / probe_failed flags
 *      and the EL1 Data Abort recovery path in sync_handler (cpu.c).
 *   3. SMP bring-up (arch_smp_init): wake secondary CPUs via PSCI CPU_ON
 *      (arch_cpu_wake_secondary, start.S), wait for each to acknowledge, and
 *      create an idle task for each newly-online CPU.
 *
 * Known issues:
 *   ARCH-04 (W2 BAD-IMPL·BUG) The manual probe fallback writes arch_mem_regions[0]
 *            TWICE: once at lines 83–86 (after finding found_end), and again at
 *            91–94 (the "safety" adjustment).  The second write silently overwrites
 *            the first, making the lines 83–86 dead.  The size computed in the second
 *            write also subtracts PAGE_SIZE regardless of whether found_end > probe_base,
 *            which can produce size == 0 when found_end == probe_base. [static]
 *   ARCH-05 (W2 REFINE) The probe reads at 128MB intervals (0x08000000) from the
 *            QEMU virt base.  On real hardware some physical addresses in the probe
 *            range map to device registers that do not cleanly abort; a read could
 *            trigger an unintended device side-effect before the sync exception fires.

 *   2. Parse the Device Tree Blob (DTB) passed by the firmware/QEMU in x0 at
 *      kernel entry.  The DTB pointer is saved as boot_fdt_ptr in start.S.
 *      fdt_init() makes the FDT available for subsequent fdt_get_mem_regions()
 *      and fdt_count_cpus() calls.
 *
 * If boot_fdt_ptr is NULL (no DTB from firmware), hardware discovery falls back

/*
 * arch_platform_get_mem_regions - discover and return usable RAM regions.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   count  Output: number of valid entries in the returned array.
 * Returns: pointer to the static arch_mem_regions[] array.
 *
 * Idempotent: if arch_region_count > 0 the cached result is returned immediately.
 *
 * Primary path — FDT memory parse:
 *   fdt_get_mem_regions() walks the FDT "/memory" nodes and fills arch_mem_regions[].
 *   On QEMU virt with a DTB, this correctly discovers all RAM (e.g., 3967 MB at
 *   0x40000000 for "-m 4G").
 *
 * Fallback path — manual physical probe (NOTE(ARCH-04), NOTE(ARCH-05)):
 *   When FDT parse fails or returns 0 regions, the code performs a bus-abort probe:
 *   - Start at 0x40000000 + 1GB (skip the kernel's own 1GB).
 *   - Advance in 128MB (0x08000000) steps up to a 128GB ceiling.
 *   - For each candidate address: set probe_in_progress, attempt a volatile read,
 *     then check probe_failed (set by sync_handler if a Data Abort fires).
 *   - Stop when probe_failed is true; found_end is the last successfully read addr.
 *
 *   NOTE(ARCH-04): The probe result is written to arch_mem_regions[0] TWICE:
 *     First write (lines 83–86): base=probe_base, size=found_end-probe_base.
 *       This is immediately followed by arch_region_count=1 and a pr_info.
 *     Second write (lines 91–94): base=probe_base, size=(found_end-probe_base-PAGE_SIZE)
 *       or 0.  This is the effective write; lines 83–86 are dead code.
 *     The second write also sets arch_region_count=1 redundantly.
 *     If found_end == probe_base (nothing found), size is set to 0.
 *
 *   NOTE(ARCH-05): The probe reads at 128MB intervals from 0x40000000+1GB.
 *   On QEMU virt this is safe because physical RAM is at 0x40000000 and the
 *   machine model aborts reads above the configured RAM ceiling.  On real
 *   hardware some addresses in the range may be device registers; a read can
 *   cause an unintended side-effect before the abort arrives.

 *      (start.S:159-161) before enabling their MMU.  The cache clean in
 *      arch_vmm_set_secondary_pgd ensures secondaries see the correct value.

 *      FDT reports 0 (e.g., no FDT or FDT without cpu nodes).
 *   3. Pre-allocate kernel stacks for all CPUs via arch_smp_setup_stacks().
 *      This must be done before any CPU is woken to avoid races on the stack
 *      array.
 *   4. For each secondary CPU i (1 .. cpu_count-1):
 *      a. Obtain or allocate the kernel stack top for CPU i.
 *      b. Call arch_cpu_wake_secondary(i, kernel_secondary_main, stack):
 *         Issues PSCI CPU_ON HVC (start.S:arch_cpu_wake_secondary) to ask the
 *         firmware to start CPU i at secondary_startup with stack as context_id.
 *      c. If wake succeeds (ret==0): create an idle task for the new CPU
 *         (smp_create_idle_task), then spin-wait on cpu_boot_ack == i with a
 *         10M-iteration timeout.  cpu_boot_ack is set by kernel_secondary_main
 *         after the secondary CPU completes its arch_cpu_init().

 * cpu_boot_ack is a volatile uint32_t written by the secondary CPU; the primary
 * CPU spins with arch_nop() (which typically maps to a WFE-like instruction or

 * ordered hardware the secondary CPU's write to cpu_boot_ack may not be visible
 * without a load-acquire or explicit barrier on the primary side.  On QEMU this
 * works in practice because the HVC and the memory writes are serialised through
