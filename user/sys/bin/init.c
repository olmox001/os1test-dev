/*
 * user/sys/bin/init.c
 * Process 1 — System Initializer and Service Supervisor
 *
 * This is the first userland process launched by the kernel after boot.
 * It is responsible for:
 *   1. Spawning the two mandatory system services (notify_srv, shell) in order.
 *   2. Sending the "Boot Complete" notification via IPC to notify_srv.
 *   3. Running a non-blocking supervisor loop that detects child exits and
 *      respawns the dead service immediately.
 *
 * Calling convention / runtime:
 *   _start (user/arch/<arch>/syscall.S) sets up the stack and calls main();
 *   main() never returns (the supervisor loop is infinite).
 *
 * Known issues:
 *   USR-INIT-01  (W1 REFINE) Supervisor is a correct non-blocking poll today;
 *                the PID-reuse hazard is NOT live — next_pid is a monotonic
 *                counter (kernel/sched/process.c:20,233); PIDs are never
 *                recycled.  A generation/owner check would be needed if PID
 *                recycling is ever introduced.
 *   USR-INIT-02  (W3 MISSING·DOC) init.cfg is never read despite the TODO
 *                comment below being stale: file_read (lib.c:72) is fully
 *                implemented and used elsewhere.  The paths in init.cfg
 *                (/notify_srv.elf, /shell) do not match the actual rootfs
 *                layout (/sys/bin/notify_srv, /sys/bin/shell).
 *   USR-INIT-03  (W2 BAD-IMPL) No respawn rate-limiting: a service that
 *                crashes immediately will be respawned in a tight loop,
 *                saturating the process table (MAX_PROCESSES=64, os1.h:16)
 *                with zombies until the system stalls.
 *   USR-SEC-01   (W3 SECURITY) notify_srv writes its PID to the global registry
 *                key "srv.notify_pid" with no authentication; any process can
 *                overwrite that key to hijack all system notifications.

 * Spawns notify_srv and shell, fires the "boot complete" notification, then

 *
 * No parameters, no meaningful return value (return 0 is unreachable dead code
 * because the while(1) loop never exits).
 *
 * Side effects:
 *   - Creates two child processes via SYS_SPAWN.
 *   - Sends one IPC notify message to the notification server.
 *   - Calls SYS_FLUSH to push any buffered output before entering the loop.

   * wait(pid) maps to _sys_wait which calls kernel process_wait().
   * process_wait() is NON-BLOCKING and a PURE REPORTER:
   *   returns -1  if the named process is still alive,
   *   returns pid if the process is a corpse not yet drained by the
   *               scheduler's reaper,
   *   returns -2  if not found — either it never existed or it was ALREADY
   *               auto-reaped by schedule() (the kernel frees corpses on its
   *               own since the zombie-leak fix; a victim killed while
   *               parked is freed immediately and never appears as a
   *               waitable corpse).
   * Both pid and -2 therefore mean "child is gone": testing only ==pid made
   * the respawn a race against the kernel reaper (won on some boots/arches,
   * lost on others — the amd64 no-respawn report).
   *
   * NOTE(USR-INIT-01): This is a correct poll loop.  PIDs are monotonic
   * (next_pid, process.c) so a respawned service can never collide with the
   * surviving service's PID.  A failed spawn (pid <= 0) also yields -2 and
   * is retried on the next iteration.
   *
   * NOTE(USR-INIT-03): There is no respawn backoff or rate limit.  A crashing
   * service is respawned immediately on every supervisor iteration, which can
   * exhaust the process table before the system stabilises.
