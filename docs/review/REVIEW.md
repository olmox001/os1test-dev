## 1. Headline: verified runtime behaviour (claim vs reality)

The project is presented as "boots correctly on `make run` for both arches, graphical,
virtio, detecting CPUs, mapping up to 4GB, running GUI + TTY shell." Built and run
headless (QEMU, serial capture):

| Capability | aarch64 (`make run`) | amd64 (`make run`, `-kernel`) |
|---|---|---|
| Builds (strict `-Werror`…) | ✅ clean | ✅ clean |
| Boots to **TTY shell in a composited window** | ✅ | ✅ **at `-m 3G`** |
| RAM detection | ✅ **3967 MB, dynamic** | ❌ **magic `0x0` → hardcoded 1 GB** (ignores `-m`) |
| Maps "up to 4GB" | ✅ | ❌ (1 GB only) |
| SMP (cores online) | ✅ **4/4** (work-stealing) | ⚠️ boots; weak detection |
| `-m 4G` | ✅ | ❌ **crash** (virtio queue size 0 → divide-by-zero) |

**Verdict:** the aarch64 path genuinely delivers the stated asset. The amd64 path
delivers it **only at ≤~3 GB via `make run`**; the 4GB/real-memory-map path works only
through the **GRUB-ISO (`make release`)** route — which is what the old, more confident
reports actually tested. This is the single most important correction in the review.

### The amd64 critical chain (root-caused, verified)
`make run` boots amd64 via QEMU `-kernel` → PVH entry (kernel has MB2+PVH headers, **no
MB1**) → magic arrives as `0x0` (**BOOT-01**) → platform hardcodes **1 GB** (**BOOT-02**) →
at `-m 4G`, QEMU puts the virtio-pci 64-bit BAR above 4 GB → **`pci_get_bar` truncates it
to 32 bits** (**DRV-VIRTIO-01, W5**) → `QUEUE_NUM_MAX` reads 0 → divide-by-zero → amd64
has **no user/kernel fault isolation** so it **halts** (**EXC-AMD64-02**).

## 2. Severity rollup (all 9 subsystems)

| Severity | Count | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **W5** Critical | 3 | DRV-VIRTIO-01 (4G crash), EXT4-01 (extent format), VFS-01 (no VFS layer) |
| **W4** Severe | 9 | boot/4GB, stack-DMA, IRQ no-op, font UAF, ELF map-escape, no-capabilities, ext4 write+no-ACL |
| **W3** Significant | 60 | bugs/SMP-races/security/wrong-design on used paths |
| **W2** Moderate | 101 | limitations, partial behaviour, refinements |
| **W1** Minor | 42 | dead code, stale comments, micro-perf |
| **W0** Info | 5 | cosmetic |
| **Total** | **~220** | actionable tier (W3+) = **72** |

## 3. Cross-cutting themes → foundations (the refactor spine)

These recur across subsystems and are the dependency-ordered foundations (see charter §5):

1. **PA/VA model + W^X** — everything silently assumes identity mapping; all RAM is mapped
   executable. (MM-VMM-01/02, AMMU-01/02, ELF-02)
2. **Coherent, capability-checked ABI** — mixed/duplicated syscall numbers, no errno, no fd
   table, **zero capability checks**. (ABI-01/02/03/04, USR-SEC-01/02/03, LIB-REG-02)
3. **Real allocators** — kmalloc never frees to PMM; PMM has no buddy; userland malloc gaps.
   (MM-KM-01, MM-PMM-02/03, USR-MALLOC-01..05)
4. **Boot stability (GPLv2-compatible loader)** — amd64 boot-protocol mishandling. (BOOT-01/02)
5. **Thin HAL + real drivers/device-tree** — over-abstracted MMIO path; many driver stubs/races.
   (HAL-01, DRV-*, ARCH-01/02)
6. **Service isolation (seL4)** — compositor/font/vfs in-kernel and entangled with the scheduler.
   (SCHED-01, GFX-COMP-03, GFX-FONT-01, USR-SEC-03)
7. **SMP correctness** — no TLB shootdown; multiple lock-free shared-state races.
   (MM-VMM-05, AMMU-08, IRQ-02, DRV-UART-01, GFX-COMP-01/02, UACC-*-TOCTOU)
8. **Process/IPC model** — lost-wakeup race, unbounded IPC, non-blocking wait, no W^X for users.
   (IPC-01, SCHED-05, ELF-01)

## 4. Critical & severe findings (W5 / W4) — full

| ID | Sev | Kind | Location | Summary |
|----|-----|------|----------|---------|
| DRV-VIRTIO-01 | W5 | BUG | `pci/pci.c:106`, `amd64/hal.c:26-37` | 64-bit BAR truncated to 32 bits → garbage MMIO base at `-m 4G` → queue size 0 → divide-by-zero. **Root cause of the amd64 4G crash.** |
| BOOT-01 | W4 | BUG·WRONG-DESIGN | `amd64/boot/start.S`; `platform.c:157-186` | No MB1 header; QEMU `-kernel` uses PVH; magic expected in a register never matches → unknown protocol. |
| BOOT-02 | W4 | BUG | `platform.c:173-185` | Falls back to hardcoded 1 GB; 4GB unreachable on `make run`; fragile → 4G crash. |
| DRV-VIRTIO-03 | W4 | BUG·SECURITY | `virtio/virtio_blk.c:99-120` | `req`/`status` on the kernel **stack** used as DMA targets; device writes to stack; no coherency/alignment. |
| IRQ-01 | W4 | WRONG-DESIGN | `timer/pic_pit.c:57-59`, `irq/irq.c:87-135` | `acknowledge()` always returns 1023; generic `irq_handler` is a no-op on amd64; real dispatch bypasses the chip EOI contract. |
| GFX-FONT-01 | W4 | SECURITY·BUG | `graphics/font.c:174-191`, `syscall_dispatch.c:234` | `sys_set_font` stores a **raw user pointer** into kernel globals, dereferenced during IRQ-context rendering → UAF / info-leak. |
| ELF-01 | W4 | SECURITY | `sched/elf.c:48-92` | No `p_vaddr` range check; process PGDs share kernel upper-half by reference → crafted ELF can corrupt kernel page tables. |
| ABI-04 | W4 | SECURITY | `core/syscall_dispatch.c:151,166,176,251` | No capability checks: any process can kill any PID, steal focus, destroy windows, write any file. |
| EXT4-01 | W5 | BUG·MISSING | `fs/ext4.c:278-316`, `ext4.h:103` | Driver never reads `i_flags`; can't detect ext4 **extent-format** inodes → garbage reads on standard `mkfs.ext4` images (works only via `mkdisk`'s hand-built block-mapped inodes). |
| VFS-01 | W5 | WRONG-DESIGN | `fs/vfs.c`, `vfs.h` | "VFS" is a 59-line path-normaliser: no vnode, no mount table, no `file_ops`; FS syscalls call `ext4_*` directly. Primary blocker to Plan 9 / seL4-service goals. |
| EXT4-02 | W4 | SECURITY | `core/syscall_dispatch.c:176-199` | `FILE_WRITE` has no access control — any PID can overwrite any file, including `/init`. |
| EXT4-03 | W4 | DOC·BUG | `fs/ext4.c:3,234` | "Read-Only" header is false: `ext4_write_file` really persists to disk (capped 48 KB / 12 direct blocks). |

(Full W3 table and the W2/W1/W0 detail live in the per-subsystem docs; the W3 set is the
remaining actionable tier and is the basis for the issue batch — see §6.)

## 5. Corrections & reconciliations (review integrity)

Maintainer spot-checks of agent-delegated analysis corrected the following before anything
was published — recorded for transparency:

- **My own early errors, retracted:** (a) I claimed init's supervisor loop was "broken
  (blocking wait)" — wrong; `process_wait` is non-blocking, the loop is a valid poll.
  (b) I claimed `draw3d.c` "doesn't exist" — it exists but is **not compiled** (orphan).
- **Reconciled inference:** the amd64 4G crash I first attributed to MMIO-mapping range
  (AMMU-07) is actually **DRV-VIRTIO-01** (64-bit BAR truncation), confirmed by source.
  AMMU-07 downgraded to a lesser, separate MMIO-coverage limitation.
- **Agent overstatements caught & downgraded:** USR-INIT-01 "PID-reuse W3" → **W1**
  (`next_pid` is monotonic, no reuse). USR-MALLOC-01 calloc mechanism reworded (the
  `memset` is in-bounds; the *caller* overflows). LIB-MATH-01 "all 3D corrupted W3" →
  **W2 latent** (only consumer `draw3d.c` is not compiled).
- **New cross-cutting finding surfaced:** orphaned/uncompiled source files exist in-tree
  (`graphics/draw3d.c`, `bin/test_init.c`, the dead `user/sys/lib/syscall.S`) — dead code.
- **Retraction (post-fix, maintainer-corrected):** SCHED-UAF-01's *aarch64* crash trace (the
  `addr2line` hit at `process.c:937`) was a **false trace from a drafted-but-unapplied fix** and
  does not reproduce; the teardown use-after-free is **amd64-only** (§9 corrected accordingly).

Provenance: docs **01, 02, 09** hand-written by maintainer; **03–08** agent-generated and
maintainer spot-checked (top/critical findings verified against source; **07, 08** carry
explicit correction notes). Every finding cites `file:line`.

## 7. Issues (GitHub)

The W3+ actionable tier (**72 findings**) is filed as individual GitHub issues on
`olmox001/os1test-dev`, labeled by severity (`w3`/`w4`/`w5`), kind (`bug`, `security`,
`wrong-design`, `missing`, `stub`, `bad-impl`, `refine`, `perf`, `review-doc`) and
`area:*`, all tagged `code-review`. W0–W2 findings remain in the per-subsystem docs above.

- **Tracking epic:** [#19](https://github.com/olmox001/os1test-dev/issues/19)
- **Per-finding issues:** [#20–#91](https://github.com/olmox001/os1test-dev/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Acode-review) (72)

Each issue body carries the `file:line` location, the finding text (maintainer-corrected),
and a pointer to its subsystem doc + this index. They are the unit of work for the
delegated fix phase (Phase 3).

## 8. Phase 3 — fixes landed (branch `comprehensive-review`)

Each verified by build (both arches) + headless QEMU runtime, committed separately.
The boot/crash fixes were delegated one-agent-at-a-time and maintainer-verified before
commit. For the W3 issue-tier rows: #80/#62 were agent self-verified under the authorized
build+boot workflow; #98/#59/#63/#42/#70/#50/#74 (this session) were each verified by an
independent build on both arches + headless boot on both arches before commit (several were
implemented by delegated sub-agents that did not commit), **pending maintainer review**.

| Commit | Fix | Issue |
|---|---|---|
| `0c5dc0a` | amd64 read full 64-bit PCI BAR (virtio.c + hal.c) + `arch_vmm_map_device` | **#44** (W5) ✅ |
| `89c3a52` | amd64 clone high device-MMIO PML4 entries into process PGDs (fixes ≥4G `0xc0…` fault) | part of #94 ✅ |
| `fedd9e2` | amd64 detect PVH via `hvm_start_info.magic` → real memory map (up to 4GB+) | **#28, #29** ✅ |
| `8b03255` | amd64 `*(.lbss*)`→`.bss` so PMM metadata no longer overlaps `cpu_data` (SMP `current_task` page-fault) | runtime-discovered ✅ |
| `b3ea74f` | aarch64 real DTB via `-dtb`/raw `kernel.bin` (FDT works, `x0` set) + SMP fallback cap 64→8; `-m 5G` default both arches | runtime-discovered ✅ |
| `3f9f81f` | userland `calloc(nmemb,size)` integer-overflow guard (pre-multiply `size > SIZE_MAX/nmemb` check) | **#80** (W3) ✅ |
| `c6c268a` | bound user-supplied I/O buffer size at 16 MiB before `kmalloc` (FILE_WRITE/READ/LIST_DIR, cases 251/252/254) | **#62** (W3) ✅ |
| `6fd1b47` | graphics: capture the IPC message + close decision under `compositor_lock`, then **release it before** `kernel_ipc_send`/`process_terminate` in `compositor_handle_click` → resolves the AB-BA freeze on window-close/kill | **#100** (W4) ⚠️ freeze only |
| `848d6c8` | sched: clamp `sys_getprocs` `max_count` to `MAX_PROCESSES` before `kmalloc` (unchecked multiply + unbounded alloc) | **#98** (W3) ✅ |
| `8e01551` | fs: `struct ext4_group_desc` `padding[14]`→`[12]` (34→32 B, matches the on-disk GDT entry; stops multi-group write corruption) | **#59** (W3) ✅ |
| `7839076` | fs: abort to the MBR parser on partition-entry CRC mismatch in `gpt_init` (mirrors the header-CRC fallback) | **#63** (W3) ✅ |
| `0e6a790` | arch: null-guard `current_process` in aarch64 `arch_copy_to_user` (mirrors `arch_copy_from_user`) | **#42** (W3) ✅ |
| `d02038d` | graphics: floor `graphics_font_height()` to the built-in default when `ascent+descent<=0` (compositor div-by-zero) | **#70** (W3) ✅ |
| `392d7fc` | drivers: check `pmm_alloc_pages/_page` returns in `virtio_input` `init_device` (NULL-deref → graceful bail) | **#50** (W3) ✅ |
| `94c936c` | lib: `ktest` counts real pass/fail via a `ktest_test_failed` flag set by `KASSERT` (was always N PASS / 0 FAIL) | **#74** (W3) ✅ |

Rows `3f9f81f` through `94c936c` are the **W3 issue-tier** fix phase — small, scoped, additive
correctness/security hardening on the issue backlog, distinct from the boot/crash fixes above.
Each was verified by build (both arches) + boot (no regression). Where the fixed path is not
exercised at boot (the capped/overflow guards #80/#62/#98, the multi-group write #59, the
CRC-mismatch fallback #63, the alloc-failure bails #50, the malformed-font floor #70, the
aarch64 null guard #42), the standard is build + no-regression + correct-by-inspection.
LIB-KTEST-01 (#74) additionally had its FAIL path proven by a throwaway broken assertion
(→ 2 PASSED / 1 FAILED) before reverting.

`6fd1b47` (GFX-COMP-13, **user-reported W4**) is a real SMP lock-ordering fix — verified by
build (both arches) + boot. **It resolves only the freeze / AB-BA deadlock**; the companion
zombie/no-reap symptom (when `process_terminate` runs from mouse-IRQ context) is a **separate,
still-open** fix tracked via SCHED-03, and the underlying compositor↔sched coupling stays open
as GFX-COMP-03 (#69).

**Verified runtime status now:** amd64 boots clean at `-m 3G / 5G / 8G` (detects 6–9 GB,
virtio-blk + Ext4, 4 SMP cores, no faults); aarch64 FDT-driven (real RAM + CPU count),
boots to the TTY shell.

**IPC → 64-bit: already satisfied (verified).** `struct ipc_message`
(`include/api/posix_types.h`) already carries `uint64_t data1; uint64_t data2; char
payload[64];` — present since `main` — and all producers/consumers use 64-bit
(keyboard packs `(uint64_t)code<<16`, `lib.c` reads `data1>>16`, `ipc_send`/`ipc_recv`
use 64-bit). Exercised at runtime every boot (keyboard input + `notify()`). No change needed.

**Remaining (open, future sessions — multi-step refactors, not concludable in one short pass):**
amd64 ACPI-MADT CPU count (ARCH-01), real PCI/ACPI init (ARCH-02), user-vs-kernel
fault isolation (EXC-AMD64-02); the kernel/userland higher-half **addressing rework**
(the central PA==VA invariant); W^X (MM-VMM-01/AMMU-01); and re-commenting the headers
+ `.S` files reverted in Phase 2 (all C sources are commented and committed).

## 9. amd64 runtime crashes — root-caused (fix pending)

Two amd64 runtime defects were precisely root-caused via headless QEMU + interactive
`make run` (serial capture, an in-#PF-handler PGD walk). **SCHED-UAF-01 is now fixed**
(below, verified by build + boot + a kill-stress on both arches); **ARCH-AMD64-APPGD-01
remains open**, recorded here with its exact mechanism and fix direction for a focused
follow-up.

**SCHED-UAF-01 — process-teardown use-after-free; crash on window-close (amd64). [FIXED]**
*Mechanism:* closing a window (compositor close button → `process_terminate`) could leave the
terminated process **still linked in a per-CPU runqueue** when its `struct process` page was
freed (and PMM-poisoned `0xCC`); `schedule()`'s O(1) pick and the **work-stealing** path then
dereferenced the freed node (`next->priority` on a poisoned struct) → GPF → triple-fault →
reboot on amd64. *Root cause:* `process_terminate` mutated `state`/`run_list`/`on_cpu` under
the **global** `sched_lock`, while `schedule()` mutates them under the **per-CPU** `sched_lock`
— not mutually exclusive, so a victim could be re-enqueued (resurrected), left DEAD-but-queued,
or freed while still referenced.
*Fix (landed in `kernel/sched/process.c`):* the scheduler is now the sole owner of runqueue
membership and of freeing runnable processes. `process_terminate` marks a RUNNING/READY victim
**sticky `PROC_DEAD` under the owning CPU's `sched_lock`** (re-validating `on_cpu`) and never
frees or dequeues it; the scheduler reaps it — a running victim via the `prev==DEAD` path, a
queued victim via a new `pick==DEAD` path — both feeding a per-CPU **reap stack** (chained via
the unused legacy `process.next`) drained at the top of `schedule()` outside the lock.
`__enqueue_task` refuses `DEAD/ZOMBIE` (no resurrection) and work-stealing skips corpses.
Sleeping/created victims are freed immediately under the global lock; self-exit stays ZOMBIE.
*Verified:* clean build + boot on both arches, plus a kill-stress driving `process_terminate`
of RUNNING `demo3d` victims across `-smp 4` (50× to completion on aarch64, 11× on amd64) with
**no crash / PAGE FAULT / triple-fault / corrupt run_list**. Interactive close-button
(mouse-IRQ) confirmation pending maintainer. *Related (still open):* the compositor calls
`process_terminate` from mouse-IRQ context — design coupling tracked as SCHED-03 / GFX-COMP-03.

**ARCH-AMD64-APPGD-01 — APs run on the stale boot PML4 → high device-MMIO faults.**
`start.S` has `kernel_pgd_phys: .quad boot_pml4`, and `arch_cpu_wake_secondary`
(`platform.c` ~:459) launches APs with CR3 = `kernel_pgd_phys`. But `arch_vmm_init_hw` /
`vmm_dynamic_remap` switch the BSP to a **new dynamic `kernel_pgd`** (the one
`arch_vmm_map_device` later populates with the >4GB virtio BARs at `PML4[1]`);
`kernel_pgd_phys` is never updated. APs therefore run on **`boot_pml4`**, whose `PML4[1]` is
absent → a device IRQ touching high MMIO from an AP/idle (e.g. the virtio-input ISR at
`0xc000005000`) page-faults. *Confirmed:* an in-#PF PGD walk showed `cr3=boot_pml4
(≠ kernel_pgd)`, `PML4[1]=0` while `kernel_pgd PML4[1]` is present. *Fix direction:* set the
AP trampoline CR3 to the current dynamic `kernel_pgd` (`(uint32_t)(uintptr_t)kernel_pgd` —
identity-mapped, VA==PA) in `arch_cpu_wake_secondary`, or update `kernel_pgd_phys` after the
dynamic remap. (Verified no-regression in isolation — 4 APs still come online — but it was
bundled with the reverted SCHED-UAF work, so it is not committed.)
